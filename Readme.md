Problem statement and Goal:
Accurately assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers is vital for financial institutions to mitigate the risk of defaults.This project presents a loan defaulter prediction system utilizing a Kaggle dataset. We address the problem of predicting loan defaulters by training and evaluating three distinct models.Our objective is to compare the performance of these models and determine which one yields the better accuracy and precision in classifying the loan applications

Supervised Decision Trees & Semi Supervised Decision Trees:

Packages Used & their installation commands:
1. pandas: pip install pandas
2. matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
3. numpy: pip install numpy
4. scikit-learn: pip install scikit-learn
5. category_encodes: pip install category_encoders

Training and testing the model:
1. Obtain the training and testing data, from the "Data" directory ("loan_train_sampled.csv" and "loan_test.csv").
2. Please ensure that the file paths in the for the training data and testing data is correctly added.
3. After installing all the necessary packages and setting the PATH for the Data. Please Select RUN ALL cells in
